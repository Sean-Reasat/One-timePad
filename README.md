 So how this works is by Assigning each letter a numerical value, so A is 0, B is 1, and so on
 
 
 this is a key on how it would work.
 
     h       e       l       l       o  message
   7 (h)   4 (e)  11 (l)  11 (l)  14 (o) message
+ 23 (X)  12 (M)   2 (C)  10 (K)  11 (L) key
= 30      16      13      21      25     message + key
=  4 (E)  16 (Q)  13 (N)  21 (V)  25 (Z) (message + key) 
      E       Q       N       V       Z  â†’ ciphertext
      
      So the key adds on to it and the person takeing receiving takes it away and uses the key to find out the letters.

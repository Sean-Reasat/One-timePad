# Computer Code

The one-time pad is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked. this means that it requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is no smaller than the message being sent. A one time pad key is truly random one can calculate any plaintext from a given ciphertext. this makes it impossible to crack.

the code looks something like this. in this code is a random code only the person reciving will know.

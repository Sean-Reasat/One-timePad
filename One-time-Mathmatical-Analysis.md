There are 6.1561195802072 x 10^36 different possibilities for the key.
There is no possible way to decode the message without a key.
A plaintext is paired with a random secret key (also referred to as a one-time pad). Then, each bit or character of the plaintext is encrypted by combining it with the corresponding bit or character from the pad using modular addition.
